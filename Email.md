Hi Joe

I hope you are well

I want to get clarification on the requirement given in order to ensure that we provide the best service that is within budget and completed on time.

## Please answer the following questions

    1. How many unique transaction flows do you have?
    2. For each unique transaction flow:    
        2.1. what are the expected Input and Output including mandatory and optional felids?
        2.2. what is the expected file size if any?    
        2.3. How many transactions are you expecting per Day/Hour/Minute?    
        2.4. Do we need a real-time response from our services or a nightly batch upload?         
            * please note that A real-time response from our service will require more effort from us to ensure reliability and most likely more   effort from your side as well.     
    
This information will also help us know how many resources (eg servers) we need to provide to ensure a reliable product.
    
Please provide us with any information that we might have missed in our enquiry

Kind Regards 
Modise Moagi
